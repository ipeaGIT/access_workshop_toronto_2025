    "text": "1.1 Workshop Summary:\nRouting and accessibility analyses are increasingly used in urban and transport research and planning. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate travel time matrices and perform accessibility analyzes in multimodal transport networks using the {r5r} and {accessibility} packages in the R programming language.\nThe workshop will also illustrate how to calculate different measures of inequality of access to opportunities and accessibility poverty, which are crucial to assess the accessibility impacts of transportation projects from a transportation equity perspective. The course is based on the book “Introduction to urban accessibility: a practical guide with R” (Pereira and Herszenhut 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r5r} is an R package for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R5, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed independently by Conveyal. Kudos to Conveyal for their amazing work.\n\n\n\nHere are a few introductory slides explaining what we cover and what we do not cover in this workshop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis workshop assumes the attendee has a basic knowledge of the R programming language. If you want to familiarize yourself with R, we recommend the books below:\n\nR for Data Science\nGeocomputation with R\nData Science in R (in Portuguese)",

Pereira  Head of Data Science  Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea), Brazil  Website | Google Scholar | BlueSkye | Linkedin |\nShort bio of the instructor:\nRafael Pereira (Rafa for short) is a senior researcher (tenured) working in the fields of urban analytics, spatial data science and transport studies at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea - Brazil), where he leads the Data Science team and the Access to Opportunities Lab (AOP-Lab). He is also a visiting professor (Bousfield Distinguished Visitor in Planning) at the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto (2024-2025). His research looks broadly at how urban policies and technologies shape the spatial organization of cities, human mobility as well as their impacts on social and health inequalities. Some of his key contributions to the fields of urban analytics and planning involve the development of new methods and open-source computational tools to the study of urban systems and transportation networks. These contributions emerge from substantive interests around social justice and sustainability issues in urban development, with particular focus on transportation equity and inequalities in access to opportunities, and the environmental impacts of built environments and mobility patterns. With a background in Sociology and Demography, Dr. Pereira obtained his PhD in Geography from the Transport Studies Unit at Oxford University.\n\n\n\n\nKarner, Alex, Rafael H. M.

    "text": "4.1 Overview of our sample data\nIn this first hands-on section of the workshop, we’ll learn a very quick and simple way to calculate spatial accessibility using the {r5r} package. In the next section, we’ll see a more flexible and robust way to do the same thing. Here we’ll be calculating the number of schools accessible by public transport within a travel time of 20 minutes.\nFirst, let’s increase the memory available to run Java, which is used by the underlying R5 routing engine. To increase the available memory to 2 GB, for example, we use the following command. Note that this needs to be run before loading the packages that will be used in our analysis.\nNow we can load the packages we’ll use in this section:\nOur case study is the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The {r5r} package brings a small sample data for this city, including the following files:\nThese data sets should be saved in a single directory (our data_path). Here’s how the land use data looks like:\n# path to data directory\ndata_path &lt;- system.file(\"extdata/poa\", package = \"r5r\")\n\n# read points data\npoints &lt;- read.csv(file.path(data_path, \"poa_hexgrid.csv\"))\nhead(points)\n\n               id       lon       lat population schools jobs healthcare\n1 89a901291abffff -51.15825 -30.05385          0       0 1214          0\n2 89a9012a3cfffff -51.21187 -30.10058        159       0    0          0\n3 89a901295b7ffff -51.16521 -30.07544       1008       0    3          1\n4 89a901284a3ffff -51.20535 -30.09005         92       0    0          0\n5 89a9012809bffff -51.19575 -30.07839        577       0    9          0\n6 89a901285cfffff -51.21108 -30.08124       1170       0  427          0\n🔎 To visualize the spatial distribution of these data, we can retrieve the geometry of the H3 hexagonal grid and explore it using an interactive map:\n# retrieve polygons of H3 spatial grid\ngrid &lt;- h3jsr::cell_to_polygon(\n  points$id,\n  simple = FALSE\n  )\n\n# merge spatial grid with land use data\ngrid_poa &lt;- left_join(\n  grid,\n  points,\n  by = c('h3_address'='id')\n  )\n\n# interactive map\nmapview(grid_poa, zcol = 'population')",

    "text": "5.3 Calculating accessibility\n\nHaving computed a travel time matrix, we can combine it with land use data to calculate accessibility. For this, we will use the {accessibility} package, which provides some fast and convenient functions to calculate several accessibility measures.\nThe package currently includes more than 7 different types of accessibility measures (see details in the package documentation website).\n\ncost_to_closest(): Minimum travel cost to closest N number of opportunities\ncumulative_cutoff(): Cumulative access based on a travel cost cutoff\ncumulative_interval(): Cumulative access based on a travel time interval\ngravity(): Gravity-based accessibility measures\nfloating_catchment_area(): Floating catchment area accessibility\nspatial_availability(): Spatial availability\nbalancing_cost(): Balancing cost accessibility measure\n\nAs basic inputs, all functions of the package require a pre-calculated cost matrix (in our case, a travel time matrix) and some land use data with the number of opportunities (e.g. schools, jobs) in each cell of the study area. Both inputs must be organized in a data.frame format. We have just seen above the structure of the travel matrix. The land use data.frame must be organized like this:\n\n# land use data\n1head(points)\n\n\n1\n\nThe land use data must contain an id column, referring to the ids listed in the travel matrix, and the number of opportunities in each location.\n\n\n\n\n               id       lon       lat population schools jobs healthcare\n1 89a901291abffff -51.15825 -30.05385          0       0 1214          0\n2 89a9012a3cfffff -51.21187 -30.10058        159       0    0          0\n3 89a901295b7ffff -51.16521 -30.07544       1008       0    3          1\n4 89a901284a3ffff -51.20535 -30.09005         92       0    0          0\n5 89a9012809bffff -51.19575 -30.07839        577       0    9          0\n6 89a901285cfffff -51.21108 -30.08124       1170       0  427          0\n\n\nNow let’s calculate a few accessibility indicators.\n\n5.3.1 Cumulative accessibility measure\n\n5.3.1.1 Threshold-based cumulative accessibility\nTo calculate a traditional cumulative accessibility measure, we can use the accessibility::cumulative_cutoff() function. Along with the travel matrix and land use data sets, we only need to pass the name of the column with the travel time values, the name of the column with the count of opportunities, and a travel time cutoff.\nHere, we calculate the number of schools accessible in 20 minutes.\n\n# threshold-based cumulative accessibility\naccess_cum_t &lt;- accessibility::cumulative_cutoff(\n  travel_matrix = ttm, \n  land_use_data = points,\n  travel_cost = 'travel_time_p50',\n  opportunity = 'schools',\n  cutoff = 20\n  )\n  \nhead(access_cum_t)\n\n                id schools\n            &lt;char&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1: 89a9012124fffff       1\n2: 89a9012126bffff       3\n3: 89a9012127bffff       3\n4: 89a90128003ffff       8\n5: 89a90128007ffff       6\n6: 89a9012800bffff       9\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 Interval-based cumulative accessibility\nPrevious studies have shown that the ad-hoc choice of a single travel time threshold can substantially influence the results of traditional cumulative accessibility measures, introducing bias into transport project evaluations and equity analyses (Pereira 2019). To overcome this issue, we have proposed a time interval cumulative accessibility measure (Tomasiello et al. 2023). This new metric estimates the average (or the median) number of opportunities that can be reached considering multiple minute-by-minute cutoffs within a given travel time interval.\nThe main advantage of this metric is that it mitigates the impacts of arbitrary choices of trip duration on accessibility analysis while preserving the computation and communicability advantages of threshold-based cumulative measures.\nHere, we calculate the average number of schools that can be reached between 20 and 30 minutes.\n\n# interval-based cumulative accessibility\naccess_cum_i &lt;- accessibility::cumulative_interval(\n  travel_matrix = ttm, \n  land_use_data = points,\n  travel_cost = 'travel_time_p50',\n  opportunity = 'schools',\n  interval = c(15,25),\n  summary_function = mean\n  )\n  \nhead(access_cum_i)\n\n                id schools\n            &lt;char&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1: 89a9012124fffff       1\n2: 89a9012126bffff       4\n3: 89a9012127bffff       4\n4: 89a90128003ffff       7\n5: 89a90128007ffff       7\n6: 89a9012800bffff       9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Gravity-based accessibility measures\nThe package also includes accessibility::gravity() to calculate gravity-based accessibility metrics in a very flexible way.\nIt includes a decay_function parameter that can receive any function to convert travel cost into an impedance factor used to weight opportunities. For convenience, the package currently includes the following functions:\n\ndecay_binary()\ndecay_exponential()\ndecay_linear()\ndecay_logistic()\ndecay_power()\ndecay_stepped()\n\nLet’s see a couple examples with logistic and negative exponential decay functions:\n\n# logistic decay\naccess_lgst &lt;- gravity(\n  travel_matrix = ttm,\n  land_use_data = points,\n  decay_function = decay_logistic(cutoff = 15, sd = 5),\n  opportunity = \"schools\",\n  travel_cost = \"travel_time_p50\"\n)\n\n# negative exponential decay\naccess_nexp &lt;- gravity(\n  travel_matrix = ttm,\n  land_use_data = points,\n  decay_function = decay_exponential(decay_value = 0.1),\n  opportunity = \"schools\",\n  travel_cost = \"travel_time_p50\"\n)\n\nHere’s a quick visualization of the shape of the decay curves we’ve used.\n\n\nCode\nnegative_exp &lt;- decay_exponential(decay_value = 0.1)\nlogistic &lt;- decay_logistic(cutoff = 15, sd = 5)\n\ntravel_costs &lt;- seq(0, 30, 0.1)\n\nweights &lt;- data.frame(\n  minutes = travel_costs,\n  negative_exp = negative_exp(travel_costs)[[\"0.1\"]],\n  logistic = logistic(travel_costs)[[\"c15;sd5\"]]\n)\n\n# reshape data to long format\nweights &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(\n  weights,\n  cols = c('negative_exp',  'logistic'),\n  names_to = \"decay_function\",\n  values_to = \"weights\"\n)\n\nggplot(weights) +\n  geom_line(aes(minutes, weights, color = decay_function),\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(. ~ decay_function, ncol = 2) +\n  theme_minimal()",

    "text": "6.1 Inequality measures\nA central question in transportation research and practice involves assessing how the accessibility benefits of transportation systems and projects are distributed across different socioeconomic and demographic groups. Transportation equity concerns are fundamentally related to two types of issues: (1) accessibility inequality and (2) accessibility poverty. In this section you will learn how to use the {accessibility} package to calculate different indicators of accessibility inequality and poverty.\nIn a recent paper, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various inequality and poverty metrics most commonly used in the transport literature (Karner, Pereira, and Farber 2024) - ungated PDF here. The slides below give a very short summary of some ideas discussed in the paper. Just enough to follow this workshop section. Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend reading the whole paper.\nIn this section, we’ll be using a couple sample data sets for the city of Belo Horizonte (Brazil), which come with the {accessibility} package. In the code chunk below, we read the travel time matrix and land use data, and calculate the average number of jobs accessible in 30 by public transport.\n🔎 Time for a quick visual inspection! We can merge our accessibility results with the land use/population data, and visualize how employment accessibility is distributed across different income groups.\nThe box plot shows a very uneven distribution of access to job opportunities. Now let’s check what we can learn about accessibility inequality and poverty in this region with a few examples.",

The FGT family is composed of three measures:\n\nFGT0: it captures the extent of poverty as a simple headcount - i.e. the proportion of people below the poverty line;\nFGT1: also know as the “poverty gap index”, it captures the severity of poverty as the average percentage distance between the poverty line and the accessibility of individuals below the poverty line;\nFGT2: it simultaneously captures the extent and the severity of poverty by calculating the number of people below the poverty line weighted by the size of the accessibility shortfall relative to the poverty line.\n\nThis function includes an additional poverty_line parameter, used to define the poverty line below which individuals are considered to be in accessibility poverty. For the sake of this exercise, we’ll consider the lowest 25th percentile of access as our poverty line, which in this example is approximately 23 thousand jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick reminder that the definition of an accessibility poverty line is ultimately a moral and political decision and not simply an empirical or technical question (Pereira, Schwanen, and Banister 2017; Lucas et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n# get the 25th percentile of access\nquant25 &lt;- quantile(access_df$jobs, .25)\n\npoverty &lt;- fgt_poverty(\n  accessibility_data =  access_df,\n  sociodemographic_data = lud,\n  opportunity = \"jobs\",\n  population = \"population\",\n  poverty_line = quant25\n  )\n\npoverty\n\n        FGT0       FGT1       FGT2\n       &lt;num&gt;      &lt;num&gt;      &lt;num&gt;\n1: 0.1478675 0.04948043 0.02862334\n\n\nQuick interpretation:\n\nFGT0: 14.8% of the population are in accessibility poverty\nFGT1: the accessibility of those living in accessibility poverty is on average 5% lower than the poverty line\nFGT2: it has no clear interpretation, but one could say that the overall poverty level/intensity is 2.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoster, James, Joel Greer, and Erik Thorbecke. 1984. “A Class of Decomposable Poverty Measures.” Econometrica 52 (3): 761–66. https://doi.org/10.2307/1913475.\n\n\nKarner, Alex, Rafael H.
